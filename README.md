# The Movie Library App
Application: https://kmpstrk.github.io/movie_library_app

The Movie Library App is a movie library that allows users to search for movies using the TMDB API and view movie details in a simple, interactive interface. The app leverages HTML, CSS, TypeScript and React to provide a responsive user experience.

## How I worked on this project
* API Integration: Integrated with the TMDB API to fetch movie data.
* Responsive UI: User-friendly interface to interact with the movie library, enabling users to search movies on phones, tablets and desktops.
* Code Structuring: Organized the project into modules and packages.

## If I had more time I would change this
* Add Tests to cover the functionalities. That would increase the reliability of the application.
* Improve Error Handling. The current error handling could be made more robust.
